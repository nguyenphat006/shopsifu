# Languages Module Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring done to the languages module to align with the new DataTable flow pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `languagesService.ts`

- Added `AbortSignal` support to all API methods
- Added proper error handling and try-catch blocks
- Improved TypeScript type safety

### 2. Refactored `useLanguages.ts`

- Implemented `useServerDataTable` hook to replace manual state management
- Added memoized callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - `getResponseData` - Extracts data array from API response
  - `getResponseMetadata` - Extracts pagination metadata
  - `mapResponseToData` - Maps API data to UI component data shape
- Improved error handling with AbortController and timeouts
- Updated CRUD methods (create, update, delete) to use AbortSignal and call refreshData

### 3. Updated `languages-Table.tsx`

- Removed redundant state management (using pagination from useServerDataTable)
- Memoized event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Updated UI to match the new design pattern
- Added title and improved layout
- Fixed pagination component to work with useServerDataTable

## Key Benefits

1. **Debounced Search** - The search functionality is now debounced automatically through useServerDataTable
2. **Abortable Requests** - API requests can now be canceled to prevent race conditions
3. **Request Timeout** - Long-running requests will automatically timeout after 8 seconds
4. **Robust Data Refreshing** - After CRUD operations, data is properly refreshed
5. **Memoized Callbacks** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders and API calls
6. **Unified Pagination Interface** - All pagination controls are now handled by useServerDataTable

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In a component
const { 
  languages,
  pagination,
  loading,
  handleSearch,
  handlePageChange,
  handleLimitChange,
  refreshData
} = useLanguages();
```

## Next Steps

This pattern should be applied to other modules in the admin dashboard, such as:

1. Users management
2. Roles management
3. Any other module using server-side pagination

The core logic is now encapsulated in the useServerDataTable hook, making it easy to apply to other modules.
